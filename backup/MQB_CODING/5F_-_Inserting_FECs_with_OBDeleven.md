# 5F - Inserting FECs with OBDeleven

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgAVFoQQ6v4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgAVFoQQ6v4)

# Requirements​


1. OBDeleven with PRO license
2. FEC/SWaP code that you want to install.

# Why I need/want to do it?​

* If you want Performance Monitor and VW is not selling activation code for it.
* If you want AndroidAuto in Porsche (Porsche will not enable it, even if you pay).
* If you move to another region and want your maps to work.

# Additional info​

* Will not work with VCDS (it can not change service to EOL).
* Good to have developer mode enabled first to access full service menu.
* Installing unsupported codes will not enable features.
* Installing self-generated codes in stock unit will not enable features. You need patch the system first. Otherwise codes will be marked as invalid.

# How to?​


1. `5F` → Change Service → End of assembly line mode (EOL)
2. `5F` → Security Access → `20103`
3. `5F` → Adaptation → Transfer of release code for a SWaP function → paste in code → write
4. `5F` → Basic Settings → Release of SWaP function → slide to start → slide to end
5. Check in service menu if code was installed.
