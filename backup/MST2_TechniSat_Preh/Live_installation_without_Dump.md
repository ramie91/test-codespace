* Put the content of the Toolbox folder on  a USB drive and add the drive to Virtual Machine too.


* Open a command prompt,  write the command `ksh /fs/usb0/install.sh` and wait till the Toolbox will be installed.  \n**==IMPORTANT:==** ==you have to change the number of usb”0” to the one where the Toolbox is stored.==\n==Use the QNX File Explorer and check which USB is the correct one.
