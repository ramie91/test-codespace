# Boot loop

Sadly, there are many bad reasons for boot loops.

If you encounter a boot loop, best is to visit [MIB2 telegram group](/doc/get-support-ImfbXvWrka) and get help.

Note down the reboot interval you see, as well as a description what you can see on your screen and if the unit is at all responding and of course what you have changed on unit before this started.
