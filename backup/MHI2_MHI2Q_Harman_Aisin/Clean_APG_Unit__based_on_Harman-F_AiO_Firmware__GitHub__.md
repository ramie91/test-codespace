# Clean APG Unit (based on Harman-F AiO Firmware (GitHub))

## **Problem description**

Harman DiscoverPro MIB2 (`3G0035021B`) with APG-Patch from 2018 freezes in navigation app after boot-up very often. Reboot needed to get system running again. Probably patch got partially destroyed by frequent map updates. Decision taken to clean device and start from the scratch.

\
SW Train Version before patch: MHI2_ER_VW==X==11_P3301 (`X` instead of `G` which blocks normal firmware update by user) & no proper green menu:

\
## **Process of installation**


1. Go to MIB solution Harman section and have a look and download the latest AiO which is matching your car brand and SW Train. In this case: `MHI2_ER_VWG11_K3342_1_AIO_MU1427-20230318`

    ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=23bf726b-4de7-4a38-8985-f2f843c95337)

   \
2. Extract all files to an SD-Card. Please refer to the GitHub from Harman-f for further information:

   <https://github.com/harman-f/MHI2_MIB2_AIO_FW_Update_Template/wiki/AIO-installation>

   \
3. I did not integrate the Gracenote database to the SD-Card at the beginning. This will show up later with an error which can be skipped and ignored during installation.

   \
4. Before installation the `metainfo2.txt` in the root folder of the created SD-Card needs to be modifed as shown here. Changes applied in this case (VW and MIB2 firmware G11):

   `MHI2_ER_VWG11_*` → `MHI2_ER_VWX11_*`           ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=e93618a1-efc9-475b-b13b-1aeac5301b0c)

   If SW Train is not adpated the installation will be refused by the device with a version conflict error:

    ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=9938384e-9046-450e-a219-4f006666b9b5)

   \
5. Insert SD-Card in Harman unit and start installation via normal Firmware update or SWDL-update. This takes a while and a couple of reboots.

    ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=b4865cc6-8ecd-447f-9db2-f26121aaa735)

   \
   Installation finished with expected Gracenote2 error.

   \
6. After reboot SW-Train was updated to latest one with `G11`; Green Menu updated as well (with small version of M.I.B. - More Incredible Bash installed)

    ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=64b3ed4d-5756-4187-8bd9-01a1792ddd32)      ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=b07839ad-b578-4c19-92dd-62efe5f4f177)

## **Problem after installation**

No FEC and SWaP Codes available (Navigation, Bluetooth, Voice Control, CarPlay and Android Auto not working)     ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=e4b317e1-5d8f-48f2-99fc-94790606e3c9)

\
## **Solution**

Symbolic link of FEC folder in the RCC file system (`/mnt/efs-persist/FEC`) needs to be removed and newly created as normal folder. AiO firmware is not able to create patched FEC/SWaP-Codes because symbolic folder FEC is not available. See also here for information: <https://mibwiki.one/doc/clean-apg-unit-weHgvX9raB>

 ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=08a27c48-4f90-4d30-aea0-c474aa8c0310)Connect PC via D-Link adapter and login into RCC port `123` with e.g. Putty or Windows Telnet. Execute both Telnet commands.

<https://mibwiki.one/doc/telnet-eb30oDc1sa>

After creating the new FEC folder in `/mnt/efs-persist` (RCC system) run the patch from M.I.B More Incredible Bash again and the FEC and SWaP codes should be created properly.
