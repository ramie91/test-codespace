# Boot Loop after reboot - M.I.B


:::info
Good news - at least in some cases

:::

\
If you encounter a boot loop or general boot issue after using M.I.B.

Directly after any operation, which ends with an automated reboot from GEM.

\
It might look like this:

* unit restart after 30-60s
* only boot screen shown
* maybe part of some GUI element, but no response to any buttons

\

:::info
Pull fuse for your MHI2 unit - wait a minute and put it back - and force a hard reset and cold boot of unit.

\
This normally fixes your issue!

\
Why this is happening some times? Good question!

We do not know…
