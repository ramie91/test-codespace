## Native video playback on MIB Standard

MIB Standard devices (`MSTD`, `MST2`) can not play video files from media storage (USB, SD, Jukebox). However it’s possible to play video files from old iPod/iPhone with 30-pin dock connector via MEDIA-IN / AMI interface.

## Video playback via CarPlay/AndroidAuto

It’s possible to install an application on the phone that can play video files on MIB display via CarPlay/AndroidAuto protocol.

## Video playback via CarPlay box

There are also devices that pretend to be an iPhone, just to gain access to the MIB display and sound system. With that it’s possible to use 3rd party operating system via MIB. This includes not only video playback but also using any application available for that system.
