# Region conversion

\
\
## Requirements


1. Quality SD card, `4GB` or more ([how to check SD card](/doc/sd-card-testing-Gxi8EpfXTg)),
2. `SWDL` patch,
3. New firmware

## Enabling Developer Mode

Developer mode access is required to perform region conversion.

Check out [5F - Enabling Developer Mode and Hidden Menu](/doc/5f-enabling-developer-mode-and-hidden-menu-WgCLoao5cH) for more information about enabling developer mode in MIB units with OBDeleven, VCDS, VCP, CarScanner.

## Patching SWDL

SWDL app (`tsd.mibstd2.system.swdownload`)needs to be patched in order to accept custom `metainfo2.txt` file. Check out [SWDL Patch - install unsupported firmware](/doc/swdl-patch-install-unsupported-firmware-0ItY5zf31T) for information about different methods of patching SWDL app in Technisat units.

## Preparing new firmware

### ZR unit

Make sure to add your device variant to the variant list in the `metainfo2.txt` file.

Make sure to change CPU ID to the one from your device in the `metainfo2.txt` file.

> This can be done with the `metainfo_link_generator.py` file from [https://github.com/lprot/MIB-Tools](/doc/httpsgithubcomlprotmib-tools-cQkzBgdnPC). Place it beside the original `metainfo2.txt` file, run the generator and enter the CPU ID from your device.

### PQ unit

Make sure to add your device variant to the variant list in the `metainfo2.txt` file.

Make sure to change CPU ID to the one from your device in the `metainfo2.txt` file.

> This can be done with the `metainfo_link_generator.py` file from [https://github.com/lprot/MIB-Tools](/doc/httpsgithubcomlprotmib-tools-cQkzBgdnPC). Place it beside the original `metainfo2.txt` file, run the generator and enter the CPU ID from your device.

## New firmware installation


1. Insert SD card with prepared firmware in `SD1` port.
2. Turn on the ignition. If you have Kessy (keyless ignition) make sure that the key stays in the vehicle during the procedure (here’s why: [Kessy & Updates](/doc/kessy-updates-JeN8RUuHyK)).
3. Turn on the unit.
4. Press and hold `MENU` button for 10 seconds to enter  `Testmode` menu
5. Go to `SWDL`, enable `Software Download Manual Download`.
6. Select `Start Download`.
7. Make sure all modules are selected.
8. Press `Start` and wait.

## Regional coding


> [!INFO]
> Review module `5F` coding and adaptation values for navigation region, radio band region, SDS region, mirror link region. More details needed.
