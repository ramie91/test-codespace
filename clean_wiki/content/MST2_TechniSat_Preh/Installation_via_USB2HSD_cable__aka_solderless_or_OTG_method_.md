**LIMITATIONS:** This method is compatible with one and two SD slot `cpu` and `cpuplus` units but not with `mainstd` units **without** `iMX6` chipset. 

Units without `iMX6` have part numbers like `xxx 035 81*` and `xxx 035 82*`. 

E.g `5Q0 035 819*`, `5Q0 035 824*`.

This will **not work** on **some** `cpuplus` units too, as the drivers included into `custom_plus.ifs` are not compatible with all types of the units.

Detailed description of how it works as well as **FREE** `imx_usb tool` (aka patcher) can be found here
