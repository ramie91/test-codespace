# mibsolution.one - fix download speed


> [!INFO]
> Due to the utilization of a proxy and limited funding [mibsolution.one](https://mibsolution.one) is known to have moderate download speeds :grin:
> 
> Furthermore, running downloads on only one connection often leads to failed downloads after a short time.
\
Therefore, a download manager which supports parallel connections on the same download and automatic resume is recommended when downloading from mibsolution.one

[Free Download Manager](https://www.freedownloadmanager.org/download.htm) is working fine for some people.

Get your copy and install it.

It integrates into Chrome and Firefox just fine.
