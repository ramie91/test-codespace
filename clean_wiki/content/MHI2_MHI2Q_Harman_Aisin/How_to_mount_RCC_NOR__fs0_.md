# How to mount RCC NOR (fs0)


> [!INFO]
> Prerequisite of using flashit is RCC NOR mounted in /dev/fs0
> 
> When for example ifs.root-stage2 is damaged, RCC is still booting but NOR is not mounted in /dev/fs0 automatically.
To check, run `ls -al /dev/fs*` and you should see a list like:

 ![](../../assets/cb0d0662-4567-4af5-b1b0-337e4c391153.png)

If this list is empty then run:

```bash
/usr/bin/stop_efs_driver.sh
/sbin/devf-generic -s0x08000000,64M,,,128k,2,1 -r -D -P 1
```

Check `ls -al /dev/fs*` again. If fs0 is there then you can run **/usr/bin/flashunlock** and **/usr/bin/flashit**. Remember, fs0 is mounted only untill next reboot.


> [!TIP]
> If **/usr/bin/flashunlock** and **/usr/bin/flashit** are not available insert m.i.b. SD into SD1 slot and try to run **/net/mmx/fs/sda0/apps/sbin/flashunlock** and **/net/mmx/fs/sda0/apps/sbin/flashit**
> 
> Alternatively, you can unpack attached **Flashit Flashlock.rar** onto FAT32 formatted SD and run **/net/mmx/fs/sda0/flashunlock** and **/net/mmx/fs/sda0/flashit**

%C	- Fast Flash File System v3 (POSIX compatible)

%C	[-aclrvV] [-b priority] [-f verifylevel] [-i index]
	[-m mountover] [-p backgroundpercent[,superlimit]]
	[-s baseaddress[,windowsize[,arrayoffset[,arraysize[,unitsize[,buswidth[,interleave]]]]]]]
	[-t threads] [-u updatelevel] [-w buffersize]

Options:

 -a              disables all automounting/enumeration of partitions
 -A              all partitions are resmgr_attach() with the AFTER flag.
 -E              do not daemonize and exit on EBADFSYS with partition num + 1
 -l              list available flash databases and exit
 -r              enable fault recovery of dangling extents chains, partial
                 reclaims, dirty extent headers and damaged extent pointers
 -R              mount read-only
 -v              display verbose info
 -V              display filesystem and MTD version information
 -b priority     enable background reclaim at priority
                 (low and high are system dependant)
 -f verifylevel  enable flash verify (def.=0, 0=meta, write=1, erase=2, all=3) 
 -i arrayindex[,partindex]
                 set first array index and first partition index for multiple
                 drivers (def.=0,0 (for /fs0p0), min=0, max=15)
 -m mountover
                 override default mountpoints assigned to file systems 
                 formatted with an empty (i.e. "") mountpoint, mountover can
                 include two %X format specifiers (as in printf) for the socket
                 index and the partition index respectively
                 (def.=/fs%Xp%X)
 -p backgroundpercent[,superlimit]
                 set parameters like background reclaim percentage trigger
                 for stale space over free space, and superseded extent limit
                 before reclaim (def.=100,16)
 -s baseaddress[,windowsize[,arrayoffset[,arraysize[,unitsize][,buswidth[,interleave]]]]]
                 set socket options (normally base physical address, window
                 size, array offset, array size, unit size, bus width and 
                 inter-leave). But the format is left flexible for socket 
                 services with customized drivers.
                 the program timeout and erase suspend timeout can be specified 
                 behind interleave to avoid infinite loop (recommended 10000,100).
 -t hi_water[,lo_water[,max]] 
                 set the attribute of thread pool (increment=1, def.=4,2,100,
                 0<hi_water<max, 0<=lo_water<=hi_water, hi_water<max<=100)
 -u updatelevel  set time Update Level (def.=0, 0=never, 1=file, 2=parent)
 -w buffersize   set append buffer size (def.=512, 0=disable)
 -L limit        set flash program retry limit
 -e <arg>        enumerate partitions only. If <arg> is a number, then automount
                 the first <arg> partitions.  If <arg> is a string, it is taken 
                 as a colon-separated list of exact pathnames to mount, if found.
 -d log          set log method
 -k blksz        set extent cache block size, default is 128k
 -o file_max     set the maximum number of files to cache, default is 64
 -x              enable software ECC mode.
 -D              enable automatic detection of ECC mode.
 -S sector_erase_latency
                 set simulated sector erase latency in ms (max = 10000).
 -P lock_mode
                 set protection mode for Spansion compatible device (def.=0,
                 0=no lock, 1=persistent lock mode, 2=dynamic lock mode)
 -T max_erase_diff 
                 set threshold value (maximum erase count - minimum erase count 
                 in a partition) to trigger wear levelling, default value is
                 two times of sector number in the partition. Typically, 
                 for very large partition containing more than 1000 sectors, 
                 this option should be used to specify a threshold 
                 (for example, 1000) to make sector erase counts more evenly 
                 distributed across the entire partition.

Examples:

%C	-w0 

Starts a flash filesystem with no append buffering.

%C	-b5 -u2 -r 

Starts a flash filesystem with background reclaim process enabled and
most POSIX semantics with an initial fault recovery when automounting.

Mountpoints:

This is for the default mountpoint index...

/fs0p0       structured flash filesystem mountpoint

/dev/fs0     socket mount mountpoint
/dev/fs0p0   raw partition mountpoint

%C -e 2 

Starts the flash filesystem, automounting /dev/fs0p0, /dev/fs0p1, and /dev/fs0p2.  Any
remaining partitions are only enumerated (entries created under /dev, but
no mounted filesystem).



Notes:

Hard links and access times are not supported with the flash filesystem.
Symbolic links, modification and change times are supported.
