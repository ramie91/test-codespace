# How to boot ifs-emergency.ifs via zmodem in CLI

If “boot -t emerg” from CLI does not run Emergency IFS as ifs-emergency.ifs partition in RCC NOR got corrupted you can use **zmodem** [CLI command](/doc/enter-ipl-jnQb14ZDOs) for uploading ifs-emergency.ifs to RAM and boot/ run from there.

This will allow you to proceed with repairing of RCC flash but only if MMX is still OK as you need SD card to be accessible via **/net/mmx/fs/sda0**


> [!INFO]
> When you stop IPL and enter CLI, you only have 30 seconds to enter commands. After 30 seconds IPL closes CLI and continues the booting process.
> 
> As uploading of ifs-emergency.ifs over zmodem at 460800 bps requires about 90 seconds you need to slow down IPL to extend timeout to 150 seconds (also known as 2:30 IPL mode)
## Slowing down IPL (getting 2:30 IPL mode)


1. [Stop IPL and enter CLI](https://mibwiki.one/doc/how-to-stop-ipl-to-enter-cli-boot-ifs-emergencyifs-and-restore-ifsroot-stage2-jnQb14ZDOs) and wait 30s so IPL continues to boot
2. Let it boot for a bit (see picture below) and power cycle unit **very** quickly

    ![power cycle very quick after IPL closed CLI and continued to boot up](assets/3ec0b4ad-995f-43fe-9054-f5bb426b7cff.redirect_id_3ec0b4ad-995f-43fe-9054-f5bb426b7cff)
3. Stop IPL and enter CLI again and run zmodem. This time you will have 150 seconds to upload ifs-emergency.ifs at 460800 bps

## [TeraTerm](https://github.com/TeraTermProject/teraterm/releases) macro for uploading of ifs-emergency.ifs


1. Copy ifs-emergency.ifs into TeraTerm folder (the macro script will search it there)
2. Copy zmodem.ttl into TeraTerm folder:

   ```javascript
   clearscreen 1
   
   ;serial port number - adjust to your COM port number
   connect '/C=8'
   ;default RCC baud rate
   setbaud 115200
   
   ;Macro waits for start input into CLI prompt
   wait 'start'
   mpause 500
   sendln
   
   ;increase baudrate to upload image before IPL closes CLI and continues booting after 60s
   send 'b460800'
   ;send 'b921600'
   mpause 500
   sendln
   mpause 500
   ;setbaud 921600
   setbaud 460800
   mpause 500
   
   ;enable zmodem
   sendln 'zmodem'
   mpause 500
   
   ;copy ifs-emergency.ifs into Tera Term installation root
   zmodemsend 'ifs-emergency.ifs' 1
   
   ;ifs-emergency.ifs automatically is loaded from memory - login with root now
   setbaud 115200
   
   ;clears received characters in the buffer of MACRO.
   flushrecv
   ```
3. Run TeraTerm
4. [Stop IPL and enter CLI](https://mibwiki.one/doc/how-to-stop-ipl-enter-cli-boot-ifs-emergencyifs-and-restore-ifsroot-stage2-jnQb14ZDOs) (do not type zmodem there, the macro will do it automatically)
5. From “Control>Macro” menu item in TeraTerm select zmodem.ttl
6. In CLI enter “start” without quotes.  The macro will identify this command and automatically enter zmodem into CLI and start `ifs-emergency.ifs` upload:

    ![zmodem upload is running](assets/799151ca-abe8-47fa-b400-38ec8eed2589.redirect_id_799151ca-abe8-47fa-b400-38ec8eed2589)
7. When the upload finishes and Emergency IFS boots, don’t forget that ifs-emergency.ifs is still only in RAM and will be lost after reboot. Flash ifs-emergency.ifs into RCC NOR as soon as possible, so you don’t need to play with slowing down IPL and zmodem uploading again. Good luck!
