# mount app.img


:::tip
For some reason this is not working all the time …

:::

\
```bash
#create new folder "mounted"
#this will aid as mounting target 
mount -uw /mnt/app/
mkdir /mnt/app/mounted

#mount app.img from e.g. SD card to the previously generated folder
mount -rt qnx6 /fs/sda0/app.img /mnt/app/mounted

#in some cases you have to add -o loop
mount -t qnx6 -o loop /fs/sda0/app.img /mnt/app/mounted
```
