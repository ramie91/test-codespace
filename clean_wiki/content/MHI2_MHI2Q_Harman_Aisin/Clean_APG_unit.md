# Clean APG unit

\

:::warning
Never login to normal RCC and MMX. There are scripts and watchdogs running on the unit which will brick the unit.

:::

\
Log into [Emergency IFS](/doc/enter-rcc-blue-efu-emergency-ifs-u6Pt9h5acV) and [manually flash complete RCC, MMX + APP](/doc/manual-firmware-restore-NglgI1RK9n).

Full SDWL FW update is recommended after reboot to make sure that all components are up to date.

\

:::info
After firmware restore, is necessary to delete the FEC link (is a link to `/protect/FEC` that doesn’t exist)

:::

\

mkdir /mnt/efs-persist/FEC
```
