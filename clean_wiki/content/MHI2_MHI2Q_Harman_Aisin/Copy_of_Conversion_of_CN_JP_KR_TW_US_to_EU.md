# Copy of Conversion of CN/JP/KR/TW/US to EU


> [!INFO]
> Conversion can be completely done via GEM and SD card.
> 
> No telnet access (dlink adapter) is required
## Step by step instruction by Enthusiast


1. Unzip the latest M.I.B. version <https://github.com/Mr-MIBonk/M.I.B._More-Incredible-Bash/archive/refs/heads/main.zip> onto a FAT32 formatted quality SD card
2. Insert SD card into **SD1 slot (IMPORTANT!)** of the MIB and install M.I.B. via corresponding [key combo](https://mibwiki.one/doc/key-combinations-and-shortcuts-7tk8NfVoLo)


> [!WARNING]
> **IMPORTANT!** After installation, check that GEM version is 4.xx+.
> 
> If you see 3.xx, that means it was not automatically updated.
> 
> In this case format SD card to FAT32 and install the latest M.I.B version again.
> 
> Repeat doing this until you see that GEM is updated to v4.12+.
3. Long press MENU button, go to **__Green Engineering Menu=>m.i.b.<=NEXT SCREEN for more magic …>advanced_settings>eu_conversion_train>Convert unit to EU__**

   **GOOD TO KNOW!** It is important to carefully read and make photos of all the screens you will see.
4. Check that train is changed to EU:             ![](assets/fd6ae412-7562-421b-aab9-829f46eff756.redirect_id_fd6ae412-7562-421b-aab9-829f46eff756)
5. Download EU firmware (**IMPORTANT!** if available use **[AIO version](https://mibsolution.one/#/1/9/MHI2%20-%20HARMAN/Firmware/Audi)**) and unpack onto FAT32 formatted SD card

   **VERY IMPORTANT!** If you did not find **AIO** firmware then go to “**advanced_settings>swdl_fw_updates**” and enable checkbox “**Enable user definded SWDL**”:

    ![](assets/d2134003-628a-4500-9ffd-6dc172cd0528.redirect_id_d2134003-628a-4500-9ffd-6dc172cd0528)

   Exit GEM but **do not reboot**!

   On **VW/Skoda/Seat** go directly to Service Mode Menu by long press MENU.

   On **Audi**, open **RED (Engineering)** menu and use **User defined**:             ![](assets/def9f5d0-9d56-4251-83a9-01b79238d1ae.redirect_id_def9f5d0-9d56-4251-83a9-01b79238d1ae)


> [!INFO]
> Set all installation packages to Y(es) state!
> 
> **IMPORTANT!** Set AMP16\*APN, AMP_BAO_P3 or Bose6416\* to **\[N\], otherwise you will need to find and flash the parametrization for amplifier!**
> 
> If you’re updating onto **MHI2_ER_AU37x_P5089,** set **FC2H37xE** to **\[N\]**, otherwise display will stop hiding to torpedo!
**VERY IMPORTANT!** If User defined will not work, then you need manual update for MMX part via Dlink!


6. Insert SD card with the firmware into SD1 slot and install it:

```
![On some units - like this one - variant might not match -> also enable "Ignore Region and Variant" in this case](assets/4d0f4ed2-23f2-420a-bf8c-0eb84fe83ddb.redirect_id_4d0f4ed2-23f2-420a-bf8c-0eb84fe83ddb)
```

If you installed not AIO version, download [20230412_M.I.B_Patches.7z](https://mibsolution.one/wl/?id=ct7tZHJ2XdRwxWAhs1cHmPMm8pk1YYGa&path=20230412_M.I.B_Patches.7z) and unpack the folder that matches installed train into the **patches** folder on M.I.B. SD. Then in M.I.B. run "**patch_unit_aio>PATCH NOW: Patch | add FECs | enable CP/AA coding | and more**"


7. Unpack EU navi maps <https://navigation-maps.volkswagen.com/vw-maps/P330_N60S5MIBH3_EU.7z>onto FAT32 formatted SD and install it.

**GOOD TO KNOW!** In case you will not be able to install maps, do **__advanced_settings>format_nav_db__**

On MHI2Q\* you cannot use this m.i.b function, so use any OBD2 adapter and software (VCP/VCDS/ODIS-E etc) that can run block 5F → Basic Settings → Format Internal Database (Memory)


8. Unpack EU RSDB <https://www.phonostar.de/download/vw/MQB2_Europe_v1.10.42.zip>onto FAT32 formatted SD and install it.
9. Download **Gracenote2 EU V22-0010-1.1.1.2679-20220316.7z** from **mibsolution.one/MQB_Solution/MHI2 - HARMAN/Gracenote** folder, unpack it onto FAT32 formatted SD card and install it.

## Where do download the latest updates:

* [EU maps](/doc/maps-download-links-8HHp8TJEMF)
* [RadioStationDB](https://mibwiki.one/doc/radiostationlogo-rsdb-yIqNQ4lkgU)
* [GraceNote](https://mibsolution.one/#/1/9/MHI2%20-%20HARMAN/Gracenote)

> [!INFO]
> If you got black screen after convertion of **MHI2_KR_AU57x_Sxxx firmware, just connect [TTL cable to quadlock](https://mibwiki.one/doc/connecting-ttl-adapter-to-uart-on-quadlock-1W9jYvWXFN), login and delete all update.txt from /net/rcc/mnt/efs-persist/SWDL/ folder.**

## Conversion from CN/EU/JP/KR/TW/US to YY and unknown trains


> [!TIP]
> Other target regions or unknown trains can also be added to M.I.B. if you share the content of the backup folder from SD card.
> 
> Upload it to [https://mibsolution.one](https://mibsolution.one/index.php/f/92129) into **M.I.B_Backup** folder and support will be added!
