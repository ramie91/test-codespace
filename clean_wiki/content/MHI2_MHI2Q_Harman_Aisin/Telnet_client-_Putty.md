# Telnet client- Putty

## Telnet client

Any Telnet client can be used. The most popular (easy to use) is <https://www.putty.org/>

\
The MHIG/MHI2/MHI2 supports two ports to login by telnet.

Each of its main components - MMX and RCC - have their own access.

·         IP for both: 172.16.250.248

·         RCC port: 123 (**recommended**)

·         MMX port: 23


:::info
Recommendation: Always use RCC, in case of wrongly used flash commands the risk to damage MMX is smaller.
