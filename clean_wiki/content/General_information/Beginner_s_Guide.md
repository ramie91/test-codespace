2. Next, go to Train version to decode/identify your current FW.

## **Guide for asking for help**

This chapter serves as a general guideline on how to ask questions in the Telegram Channel. The experts answer hundreds of questions every day, but most of the time, the clarification of the problem or getting to know what the actual problem is, takes more time than figuring out the solution. In order to smoothen the process the following crucial information should ideally be in your question.

**IMPORTANT**: The language of the Telegram channel is **ENGLISH**! Therefore, please ask your questions accordingly.


1. **What is your current FW?**

   
   1. This already contains a lot of information for the trained eyes, thus it already helps in the identification of the problem / solution.
2. **What are you planning to do?**

   
   1. It’s very self explanatory, please specify what is your goal or plan, for example the activation of CarPlay, conversion of the unit form US to EU or just a simple FW update.
3. **What have you done so far (if there is already an error)?**

   
   1. Please, be honest and tell the experts what have you done so far to reach the point where you are at the moment. Everyone makes mistakes, but not telling the honest truth regarding a caused problem can make things even worse. Just explain what you’ve done.
