# Conversion of US > EU

Below is just a bricking example that many got while trying to convert MSTD_US_VW_P4430 or MSTD_US_VW_P3470 etc without knowing what to skip: ![](assets/0d30d39d-7ebc-4d23-85e0-501e2c1e65d2.redirect_id_0d30d39d-7ebc-4d23-85e0-501e2c1e65d2)

to MSTD_EU_VW_P4470 by adding a variant to the very end of metainfo2.txt after the \[signature\] lines like:

```
[common]
Variant="17147"
Region="USA"

[common_Release_2]
Name="MSTD_EU_VW_P4470"
path=".\VW_PLUS_SSB\"
Variant="17147"
Region="USA"
```

and correspondingly into metainfo2.txt in VW_PLUS_SSB folder:

```
[common]
Variant="17147"
Region="USA"
```

This allows to install EU firmware update:  ![](assets/b0ed82a0-bc9a-479d-b802-c1b8c29f983e.redirect_id_b0ed82a0-bc9a-479d-b802-c1b8c29f983e)

But when the update finishes, you get endless bootloop: ![](assets/23649a02-8596-4872-97e5-ea96ca246f55.redirect_id_23649a02-8596-4872-97e5-ea96ca246f55)

The reason of the bootloop is crash of **CPU_HMI.EXE** (the log is collected via quadlock via TTL adapter on 115200bps speed)
