# MIB2 Wrong CP Patch Recovery

## Introduction

I’ve found it’s much easier to do things right the first time, but if you messed up there are some things you can try. If you are unsure of what CP patch to use, DON’T patch your unit as it will brick it. Reach out on Telegram or Discord and ask for help, or pay for a patch to be created if needed. If you backed up your .ifs first, you can also use this method to set it back to how it was, and then take your car to the dealership for the official CP removal. 

\
## First Steps:

Doing this work in a car will be difficult if not impossible, so a bench power supply setup is basically required. The first thing you can try is to aquire the proper .ifs file, move it to an SD card with the delphi.sh autorun, and pray that the unit still is able to boot far enough to run the script. If it is, you’ll see the familiar “completed successfully” screen and the unit should work like normal again. Try rebooting a few times as sometimes I have noticed the file gets close to copying but does not complete before the unit crashes. If your unit is still bricked, it’s time to get it set up on the bench

\
## Bench Setup:

 ![FTDI board](/api/attachments.redirect?id=bb61b7e6-8cf6-47fd-8472-5d1b2f25799c "right-50 =179x179")

To set the radio up on the bench to communicate to it you will need:

* Windows laptop with PuTTY installed
* 12v power supply 
* USB FTDI232 board

 ![My quadlock that I made](/api/attachments.redirect?id=ba72d256-81a1-4b1a-b6f8-d1233d39bfa9 "right-50 =224x221")These three things are the bare minimum, however, I reccomend a quadlock to plug into the radio. I personally used a quadlock that was included with one of my used units from eBay, and repinned it where I needed connections. However, I was able to get away with things inmy toolbox to get it running so this is just helpful. 

 ![Putty config](/api/attachments.redirect?id=7c285c6b-77ad-42c2-aac1-e8b2ec9cf598 "left-50 =224x224")

\
\
  

\
This is the config youll need to have for PuTTY. Keep in mind your COM port may not be COM7, and you wont have the saved “mib” that is highlighted blue. However, once you set the settings above you can save them as whatever you’d like.

 ![FTDI wiring to quadlock](/api/attachments.redirect?id=a399a850-44ad-4b60-8675-052ed8fc4ba5 "left-50 =224x294")

The FTDI wiring is shown here. The GND pin is easy to connect to since it is the same size as the pins on the USB board, however the Tx and Rx pins are larger and you may need to get creative if you don’t have a quadlock handy. I ended up using wire crimps and bent them into an oval shape, which worked but they barely held on and led me to eventually make the quadlock.

Once you’re all set up, press “open” on PuTTY and your command line should open. Click the phyiscial eject button on your MIB2 and it should fire up, and youll start to see text on the PuTTY terminal. If not, the wiring is likely not correct.

 ![The first few lines from my MIB2 while starting up](/api/attachments.redirect?id=7ebe7421-689f-4202-9a0d-63c42f0f8954 " =717x421")

Let your radio boot loop for a couple times and get familiar with its behavior. Take note of when (or if) the text ever stops. This is a good point to run commands as youll be able to easily see what the reply is. However, commands can be executed at any point if you need extra time for a file to copy. 

\
Here are some basic QNX commands:

```bash
ls /dev/ #lists all devices. Look for sdc1, sdc0, or a variation like sdc0t11 (t11 means fat32)
mount #lists all mounted volumes and their locations
umount [device] #unmounts device
fdisk [device] #partition manager (does not work on the MIB2, but is needed in VM)
```

The first step to recovery is getting the MIB2 to read the correct IFS that we want to copy. If your SD card is shown when you execute the “mount” command, then you are ready to attempt to copy the file.

```bash
cd / && mount -uw /sdc1/; sleep 1
cp -Vfr /sdc1/delphibin.ifs /extbin/apps/bin/delphibin.ifs; sleep 1
MountPathSync /extbin/apps; sleep 1
```

These lines are from the basic delphi.sh script that are supposed to autorun, however we can run the script sooner using our terminal connection. Copy all of the text, and press shift and insert on your keyboard to copy the lines into PuTTY, and press enter for good measure. If all goes well, you should start to see that the file is being copied, along with a percentage going up. After the file is transfered, you may need to press enter again to run the “MountSyncPath” command. 

\
If you have successfully copied the file, you should notice that after rebooting the terminal window has lots more text flowing through, and that your unit stays on longer. Both of my units still shut down until I connected it back up to the display in my car. 

## Still getting errors?

Don’t fear! you may still be able to recover your MIB. First, study the terminal window and read the errors presented when you attempt to run the script above. If you see sdc0, or sdc0t11 in /dev/ you can try replacing sdc1 with sdc0 or sdc0t11. If the above script does not run properly, it likely means that your SD card is not mounting properly or at all.

```bash
mount /dev/sdc0;
cd sdc0
```

Run the above commands seperatly. If you are able to execute the mount command with no errors (there is no output if the mount is successful) but you get an error when executing “cd sdc0” such as “corrupt file system” then your unit likely no longer has the ability to mount fat32 drives in its current state. For me, whenever I attempted to mount my SD card it would try to mount it as the qnx4 file system. 

## Formatting an SD card with the qnx4 filesystem. 

Oh boy! this was a fun one. Download Virturalbox and the QNX 6.5 ISO. Create the VM and start it up with the [QNX 6.5 ISO](https://archive.org/details/qnx-650-live). Make sure to enable passthrough for both a USB flash drive with your correct .ifs file, and the SD card you want to format. I also set the USB controller to USB 1. You must click “expert” settings to view this.


> [!TIP]
> If the QNX link is broken please reach out on Telegram
Once the VM has started, press F2 to run as a live CD, set your graphics settings, and log in (username “root”, password “root”).

 ![QNX login screen. Login: root Password: root](/api/attachments.redirect?id=998ae6b2-b999-4de5-a8c0-a1483305eb28 " =538x402")

\
Open the terminal and run “mount.” you should see your SD card and USB drive already mounted. If not, you may have an issue with the virturalbox passthrough.

```bash
fdisk dev/hd10/
```

Lets format the SD card first. It should be called hd10 or hd20. You can check the contents of the drives to confirm which is blank and which has your delphibin.ifs file. 

 ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=354b851f-6132-45e4-bcdd-aaa8b51a4f92 " =650x329")

\
Clear all 4 partitions by using the arrow keys and pressing D on each. Then highlight the first partition and press C. Type 77 enter, 0 enter, 100 enter, then S to save, and Q to quit. 

 ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=daa7866f-333f-4022-836a-cb25b53a45a5 " =646x324")

\
At this point **RESTART** the VM. You can simply type “shutdown” into the terminal to reboot. Once you have loaded back in, type “ls /dev/” and you should see “hd10t77". 

 ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=8786aa9b-528a-4c24-8b21-f06dc4981141 " =651x329")

Now for the final command to format the disk:

```bash
dinit -hp /dev/hd10t77
```

```bash
mount
```

 ![](/api/attachments.redirect?id=9364884b-9347-40b7-9ba1-b581a9fd9985 " =649x330")

\
As you can see, we now have our SD card formatted as qnx4 and it can be accessed from **/fs/hd10-qnx4-1.** Copy your delphibin.ifs using the gui file manager or command line, and insert the SD card back into your MIB2. 

## Final steps…

Congrats! It’s time to see if we can recover your MIB. With the sd card inserted and MIB set up on a bench connected to PuTTY, turn the unit on and press the shift and insert keys to copy this command:

```bash
mount /dev/sdc0 /var; #mounts the contents of the sd card into the /var/ directory
cp -Vfr /var/delphibin.ifs /extbin/apps/bin/delphibin.ifs; sleep 1 #copies the delphibin.ifs
MountPathSync /extbin/apps; sleep 1
```

Remember to press enter after the copying has finished to send the MountPathSync command. At this point, the MIB should reboot one more time (if in a bootloop) and stay on for much longer. Time to plug the display in and see if your brick has been resolved!


> [!TIP]
> Some units may not allow a mount to /var. try /home instead.
## In Progress Details (not certain on these procedures but they could help):

\
If console is so garbled you cant see outputs, or the radio is not staying on long enough, take apart the unit and insert tweezers into the two holes on the PCB located near the front panel ribbon. It may take one restart for the unit to stay on. 


> [!INFO]
> If you are having issues mounting the qnx4 SD card, attempt to short the pins on the PCB and then do the following to stop console output. This was required on one of my units.
In this state, the PuTTY terminal will be full of info making it impossible to get any feedback from commands. To resolve this, paste this into the PuTTY terminal as soon as it powers on. It may take a couple tries to get it early enough. 

```javascript
umount -f /dev/mmc0t179;
umount -f /dev/mmc0t179;
umount -f /dev/mmc0t179;
umount -f /dev/fs0p1;
umount -f /dev/fs0p3
```

This code forces all directories to unmount except for /extbin. this prevents the system from starting the services that spam the terminal window. 

If the terminal has calmed down, you must now delete the bad delphibin.ifs. 

```javascript
rm /extbin/apps/bin/delphibin.ifs
```

After, try running sync or MountPathSync /extbin. Sometimes it will not want to run depending on when the umount commands ran. However, I am unsure if sync is neccesary. Reboot the system and the console should stay calm. At this point, you can attempt to copy the correct delphibin.
