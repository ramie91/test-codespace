# MST2 activator by Congo & Duke (Official Way)


> [!WARNING]
> BEFORE YOU READ FURTHER:
> 
> 
> 1. On VW, press and hold `MENU` button on the display of your MIB2 for 3 seconds and then go to `Software Update/Versions` and take a look at `SW Train` string.
> 
>    On Audi use corresponding [button combo](/doc/key-combinations-and-shortcuts-7tk8NfVoLo) to open RED menu and then look into `Versions info`
> 2. Make sure train starts with `MST2` and ends with `D`. For example: `MST2_EU_VW_P0891D`. Only in this case, everything below applies to your unit!

> [!TIP]
> If your SW Train ends with `T` (for example `MST2_EU_VW_ZR_P0254T`) your unit is Technisat/Preh for which you need [MIB STD2 PQ/ZR Toolbox](https://mibwiki.one/doc/mib-std2-pqzr-toolbox-Ox3B2ujBUh)).
